README.md? [assume the user knows how to use ROS when writing the readme]
      
catkin_lint?

Part I
trajectory node
1. Publishes cmd_vel at fixed frequency
2. Broadcasts static transform from world -> odom
3. pause service
4. resume service
5. Parameters:
   width height period ~pub_freq
[use remapping arguments in launchfile to remap rather than creating two seaprate
publishers] -0.2
simodom
1. turtlesim/Pose subscriber
2. nav_msgs/Odometry publisher
3. odom->base_footprint broadcaster
4. Frames oriented correctly


src/homework2 python package
- Computes the trajectory properly
- Calculations are shown

catkin_make run_tests
- Proper tests provided

trajectory.yaml
turtle_view.rviz

figure_eight.launch
    mode option


Videos:
    screencast in rviz
    figure eight in turtlesim
    figure eight in realife
    Video is gif or as a sharing site


Part II
twoarm.urdf.xacro
    - uses lengths from config/arm/yaml.
arm_basics.launch
    - works and visualizes the robot
arm_traj
    - makes arm follow trajectory
arm_marker:
    properly displays the markers
arm_mark.launch
    - uses include tag
[use default argument for use_jsp so user does not need to enter it each time]
