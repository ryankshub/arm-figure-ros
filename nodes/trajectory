class Trajectory:
    """
    ROS Node responsible for figure-8 turtle control. Publishes command 
    velocities to turtle to have to it follow a figure-8 with W width, 
    H height, and complete in T seconds. Creates 2 service for controling 
    the turtle, 'pause' and 'resume'. 'pause' will stop the turtle in it's
    tracks. 'resume' will have the turtle continue following the figure 8.

    The node also broadcast a static transform from world frame to odom frame, 
    where the odom frame is aligned with world frame rotated by the turtle's
    initial heading. 

    PUBLISHERS:
        + turtle_cmd TurtleVelocity ~ linear and angular velocity of turtle

    SERVICES:
        + pause Empty ~ triggers the turtle to stop following figure-8 pattern.
            If turtle is already paused, nothing happens

        + resume Empty ~ triggers the turtle to continue following the figure-8
            pattern. If turtle is already following the figure, nothing happends 

    BROADCAST:
        + static world -> odom ~ a rotation operation by theta_0, the initial heading
        of the turtle. 
    
    PARAMS:
        + float width ~ the width of the figure 8 in meters
        + float height ~ the height of the figure 8 in meters
        + float period ~ the number of seconds to complete the figure 8
        + float x ~ the initial x position(in meters) [0,10]
        + float y ~ the initial y position(in meters) [0,10]
        + float theta ~ the initial theta position(in radians) (-pi, pi]
